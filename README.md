While living in Berlin, we realized that this city is full of creative arts, especially street art. The graffitis really pops up and look interesting to the eyes. Therefore, we would like to create a platform where people can upload and share with the community graffitis that they found interesting on the internet. 

With the task of creating a basic Express app, we implement the basic CRUD actions that allow users to create, edit and delete their own collection of it. The users should be able to:

* See the images of the graffitis
* See the details of a graffiti
* Add new graffitis
* Update existing graffitis
* Delete celebrities
